# Cook Torrance Shader
A project I decided to create on my own for my Computer Graphics course (CS:112). The project is an implementation of a type of advance shader, Cook Torrance, with one source of lighting on two choices of objects: a rabbit and a teapot.

## Launching The Project
In order to see capabilities of the code, launch the finalproject-made-from-pa2.html file.
Choosing the option "Final Project: Cook-Torrance Shading Model" in the drop menu in 'Shader' will display the implemented shader.
